Dogglers - Solution Code
==================================
This is the solution code for the Android Dogglers app.
You can use it to help guide you if you find yourself stuck.
I left the TODOs in the code so you can know exactly where you need help


However there is a catch; I intentionally left a bug which should be fun to solve,
When you build the app you are going to realise that the Gridview has some overlapping views
The bug is in the OnBindView holder, specifically the condition to choose what layout should
be used. If you solve it you can create a pull request.
